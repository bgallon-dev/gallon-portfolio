                <strong>Conference abstract.</strong> <strong>Problem:</strong>
                Mainstream histories of the 1909-10 Spokane Free Speech Fight
                often flatten the IWW campaign into strategy and spectacle,
                which obscures its moral and symbolic structure.
                <strong>What I produced:</strong> A conference presentation that
                interprets public arrests, constitutional language, and repeated
                suffering as civic ritual, with focused analysis of how
                Elizabeth Gurley Flynn is frequently misread.
                <strong>What changed:</strong> The project offers a
                counter-historiographical frame that restores ritual meaning to
                the event and gives public-history audiences a clearer
                interpretive model.

                  This presentation interrogates the “ritual forgetting” that
                  shapes mainstream histories of the 1909-10 Spokane Free Speech
                  Fight, focusing on how the archival memory of the Industrial
                  Workers of the World (IWW) has been systematically flattened
                  by the very discipline entrusted to remember it. Instead of
                  viewing the Wobblies’ campaign as mere labor agitation, this
                  chapter reads their public suffering, constitutional language,
                  and repeated arrests as a sacramental civic ritual designed to
                  expose moral fractures at the heart of American democracy.
                  Yet, as I show, canonical labor historians from Paul
                  Brissenden to Melvyn Dubofsky have routinely interpreted these
                  actions through paradigms of strategy and spectacle, denying
                  the movement’s theological and symbolic grammar. Drawing on
                  Victor Turner’s ritual theory and Carl Jung’s concept of the
                  shadow, I argue that this pattern of misrecognition
                  constitutes a ritual in its own right: a scholarly projection
                  that sanitizes dissent and reproduces the very exclusions the
                  Wobblies confronted. Special attention is given to the
                  gendered misreading of figures like Elizabeth Gurley Flynn,
                  whose suffering is often sentimentalized rather than
                  understood as liturgical defiance. In challenging these
                  historiographical conventions, my work proposes a
                  “counter-historiography,” one that restores the sacramental
                  structure of protest to the center of Pacific Northwest labor
                  memory, reframing the historian’s task as a moral act of
                  excavation and symbolic recovery. This approach not only
                  revises our understanding of the Free Speech Fight but calls
                  into question the very rituals by which collective memory is
                  shaped and policed in the Northwest and beyond.

                  <strong>Bio (program text):</strong> Benjamin Gallon is a
                  history major at Eastern Washington University and Vice
                  President of the university’s Phi Alpha Theta chapter. His
                  research centers on labor activism and civic ritual in the
                  Pacific Northwest, with a particular focus on the Industrial
                  Workers of the World and the Spokane Free Speech Fight.
                  Gallon’s work synthesizes ritual theory, depth psychology, and
                  regional historiography to reinterpret protest as public
                  liturgy. He is committed to challenging conventional
                  narratives and restoring ethical meaning to marginalized
                  histories in the region.

                <strong>Public summary:</strong> This essay argues that efforts
                to make experience, history, and other cultures intelligible
                carry a structural risk: translation and coherence tend toward
                assimilation and, in political form, domination. Through a close
                reading of Luis Villoro’s work on mysticism, language, and
                power, I reconstruct a procedural ethic in which silence
                functions inside discourse as disciplined restraint rather than
                expressive failure. The paper then extends this framework to
                intercultural philosophy and historiography, proposing that
                scholarly and civic practices can preserve plurality by citing,
                translating, and deliberating without absorbing.
